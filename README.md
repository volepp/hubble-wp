### Hubble Space Telescope wallpapers

This is a small script to fetch an image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope and set it as your wallpaper.

Executing the hubble_wp.py file will do the trick but if you want to schedule the execution (say to run it every hour) with crontab, the hubble-wp.sh file has to be used.

This is how to schedule the script to run every hour:

First you have to edit your crontab:
```
crontab -e
```
If you haven't used crontab before you have to specify which text editor you want to use.

Now add the following line to the end of the file that opens:
```
0 * * * * /bin/sh /path/to/hubble-wp/hubble-wp.sh >> /path/to/hubble-wp/log.txt
```

Remember to replace the path to your own one. Now save the file and close the text editor.

Voil√†! Now the script is scheduled to run on an hourly basis and every hour you will be greeted with a cool new picture taken by the Hubble Space Telescope!
